Hello there!

Finally I can share with you another post about react & gsap. As promised in the previous part - here, I’ll show you how to create animations when scrolling our page.

Let’s get started.

First, create new project by typing: 'npx create-react-app project-name'

After all dependencies are installed and created, we can download gsap library. To do that, we need to open terminal with project location and type: 'npm install gsap'

At the 1st step let’s clear the code from default things.

- In App.js delete all html elements except highest div
- Delete unused imports
- In App.css delete all classes except ‘.App’

```
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Now, we can use the ‘useEffect’ and ‘useRef’ hooks to make initial refs for our components. And of course, the names of variables or styling is up to you :).

```
Import React, { useRef,  useEffect } from ‘react’;
…
const App = () => {
  const titleRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
	// here will be our animation
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <p ref={titleRef}> You can animate everything!</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

After that, lets change our App.css to prepare some better styling and to make the scroll appear:

```
.App {
  text-align: center;
  background: #282c34;
  height: 250vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  color: white;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

Next lets create a separate file animations.js to handle our animations. At the top of the file lets import a few things and apply them:

```
import gsap from 'gsap';
import { ScrollTrigger } from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger';

gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);

const fromBottomToTop = ({ target, stagger, start = '0px, 50%', duration = 1, scaleX}) => {
  gsap.from(target, {
    scrollTrigger: {
      trigger: target,
      start
    },
    y: '+=50',
    autoAlpha: 0,
    scaleX,
    duration
  });
};

export default fromBottomToTop
```

Now, we can go back to App.js file to import our function and use it in the ‘useEffect’ hook:

```
import fromBottomToTop from ‘./animations’;
…
useEffect(() => {
    fromBottomToTop({target: titleRef.current, scaleX: 0.5});
  }, []);
```

And here we go! Just launch your app and see the results:

![](/animate-elements-on-page-scroll/animate-elements-on-page-scroll-tip1.avif)

I encourage you to add more components and various animations. The final version is on my github repository.
